Video game designers, also known as games designers, design games for a variety of formats, such as consoles, wireless applications, the internet and mobile phones. They decide on the overall design and purpose for the game but many also specialise in one aspect of the design, such as the story line, characters or layout. Lead designers coordinate the design aspects. A game mechanics designer works on the balance of the game and its rule system. The environmental designer creates the different scenarios and environments of the game. Designers have a different role to that of video game developers, who take designers' concepts and write the code to make them into a game that can be played.

The work of a games designer typically involves:
Coming up with new and appealing game ideas
Developing gameplay ideas
Experimenting with themes and genres
Developing plots and storylines
Developing characters
Developing maps, scenarios, and levels of difficulty
Coming up with ways of winning and losing the game
Developing user interface (menus and controls) concepts
Improving existing games
